# re-tk - hooks and helpers toolbox for common react patterns 🧰

`re-tk` is a collection of lodash-style React helpers (mostly hooks) to make everyday code quicker to write and easier to read.

It can help with common tasks like...

- [data fetching and other async tasks](#usePromise) ⏳
- [running media queries](#useMediaMatch) 🖥
- [checking if an element is in view](#useInView) 🔎

... and many more!
